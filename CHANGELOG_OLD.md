# Older Changelog — ioBroker.ai-usage

Older changelog entries are moved here by the release tooling once the README list grows too long.
## 0.3.0 (2026-08-26)

- New: ChatGPT and Google/Gemini subscriptions can now be monitored like the Claude one — each with its own guided sign-in that the settings page walks you through step by step
- New: The ChatGPT and Gemini readouts use the same endpoints the providers' own tools use, but no live subscription was available to test them on — please report anything that looks wrong
- Changed: Each account now owns exactly one node in the object tree (`claude`, `chatgpt`, `gemini`, `<name>-api`); the separate sign-in branch is gone and old nodes are cleaned up automatically
- Fixed: After signing in, the account is queried immediately instead of waiting for the next poll — no restart needed
- Fixed: OpenAI and Anthropic rows now state that they need an organisation admin key, instead of failing with an unexplained rejection

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-26)

- Changed: Completely new settings page — your stored AI credentials appear as simple on/off switches instead of a table, and new keys are picked up straight from the admin credential storage
- Fixed: The Claude subscription sign-in works reliably now — a guided card with live status, and the sign-in link stays valid until it is used instead of regenerating while you type

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-25)

- New: First release — reads usage limits, credits and costs of your Claude, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter and DeepSeek accounts into datapoints, with one warning at your chosen threshold

## 0.0.1 (2026-08-25)

- Initial development version
